Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This plugin adds schedule and event information from ATSC broadcasts to VDR
whenever such a channel is tuned.

It (partially) implements the "Program and System Information Protocol for 
Terrestrial Broadcast and Cable" from the ATSC standard.

This plugin also includes an ATSC channel scanner that is accessible through
the plugin's setup menu. If any channels are found they will be stored in
the file

            <VDR's Config Directory>/plugins/atscepg/channels.conf
            
the user can then copy the desired entries into channels.conf. The channel
numbers are determined by the "number" script.

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to copy all the files in the "config" directory into

                   <VDR's Config Directory>/plugins/atscepg/
  
and edit them according to your needs.

Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To receive ATSC broadcasts you must patch VDR with the supplied patch:

  vdr-1.7.13-atsc-0.1.0.diff        : Works with VDR 1.7.13 and above.
  
  vdr-1.7.13-atsc-tuning-0.1.0.diff : Same as above, to be use if the NA-EIT
                                      patch has been (or will be) applied.

Make sure to update your sources.conf with the patched version.
