Description
-----------
  This plugin (partially) implements the "Program and System Information 
  Protocol for Terrestrial Broadcast and Cable" from the ATSC standard.

  It adds event information from ATSC broadcasts to VDR whenever such a channel
  is tuned.

  This plugin also includes an ATSC channel scanner that is accessible through
  the plugin's setup menu. If any channels are found they will be stored in
  the file "VDR's Config Directory"/plugins/channels-atsc.conf, the user can then
  copy the desired entries into channels.conf

Notes
-----
- To receive ATSC broadcasts you must patch VDR with the 
  supplied patch: 'vdr-atsc.diff' (Works with VDR 1.4.x and 1.5.x)

  The patch was updated for v.0.0.2, it must be reapplied if you were using 
  version 0.0.1.

- You must set your time zone in the plugin's setup menu.


Example
-------
  of a channels.conf entry for an ATSC channel:

  PBS-HD:617028615:M8:T:0:49:0;52,53:0:0:3:0:2175:0

  where: Frequency = 617028615
         Source id = 3
         Transponder ID = 2175
    
  If you cannot determine the SID and TID for your channels, set them to zero
  and the plugin will output the correct values to the console (or use the ATSC
  channel scanner).

  The source can be either C (cable) or T (terrestrial)
