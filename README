Description
-----------
This plugin (partially) implements the "Program and System Information 
Protocol for Terrestrial Broadcast and Cable" from the ATSC standard.

It adds event information from ATSC broadcasts to VDR whenever such a channel
is tuned.


Notes
-----
To receive ATSC broadcasts you must patch VDR with the 
supplied patch "vdr-1.4.0-atsc.diff"


Example
-------
of an entry for an ATSC channel:

PBS-HD:617028615:M8:C:0:49:0;52,53:0:0:3:0:2175:0

where: Frequency = 617028615
       Source id = 3
       Transponder ID = 2175
       
If you cannot determine the SID and TID for your channels, set them to zero
and the plugin will output the correct values to the console.
