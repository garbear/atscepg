Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This plugin (partially) implements the "Program and System Information 
Protocol for Terrestrial Broadcast and Cable" from the ATSC standard.

It adds event information from ATSC broadcasts to VDR whenever such a channel
is tuned.

This plugin also includes an ATSC channel scanner that is accessible through
the plugin's setup menu. If any channels are found they will be stored in
the file

            <VDR's Config Directory>/plugins/atscepg/channels.conf
            
the user can then copy the desired entries into channels.conf. The channel
numbers are determined by the "number" script.

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to copy all the files in the "config" directory into

                   <VDR's Config Directory>/plugins/atscepg/
  
and edit them according to your needs.
